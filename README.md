# Project overview

This project was really challenging. I'm glad I got tested on this.

I spent about **2hrs a day** (Tuesday-Thursday) after coming home from work.

**The hardest part was the nested list**. I made a lot of nested list but manually. It was my first time doing it from a json file.

According to my understanding of the project, I created html, javascript and css files for the navbar.

I have also included a video.

Note: You may need a server (locahost) to run the project to read the json file.

**I REALLY APOLOGIZE IF MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROJECT WAS WRONG.**
